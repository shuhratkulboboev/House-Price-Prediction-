# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine learning. The following algorithms were implemented:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Dataset
The dataset `DataSet_LakasArak_labeled.csv` contains features and target labels for predicting house prices.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shuhratkulboboev/House-Price-Prediction-.git
2. Navigate to the repository::
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
3. Navigate to the repository::
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results
The models were evaluated using:

RÂ² (coefficient of determination)
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

- Random Forest Regressor outperforms the other models, offering the most accurate predictions.
- Gradient Boosting also performs well, while Linear Regression is the least accurate.
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) capture more complex data patterns than Linear Regression.
